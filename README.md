## parkinson-disease-detection-using-machine-learning
This project aims to develop a Parkinson's Disease detection system using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, and optimize its performance by tuning the hyperparameters. The project demonstrates the application of SVM for medical diagnosis and showcases the importance of hyperparameter optimization in achieving better accuracy.

### Features:
- Utilizes a dataset containing a collection of voice recordings from Parkinson's Disease patients and healthy individuals.
- Implements data preprocessing techniques such as feature extraction, normalization, and scaling to prepare the data for classification.
- Trains an SVM classifier using the preprocessed dataset to distinguish between healthy and Parkinson's affected voices.
- Explores hyperparameter tuning technique(Grid search) to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the SVM model.
- Evaluates the performance of the SVM model using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualizes the results and performance metrics using plots and charts in Jupyter Notebook.
- Provides insights and interpretation of the SVM model to understand the importance of different voice features in Parkinson's Disease detection.

### Technologies and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn for SVM implementation and hyperparameter tuning
